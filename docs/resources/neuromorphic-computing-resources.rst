Neuromorphic Computing Resources
================================

What do you need to know as background for neuromorphic research?
*****************************************************************
* Machine learning concepts
    * What is a deep neural network?
    * How do methods like stochastic gradient descent work?
* Spiking neural networks - how do they differ from DNNs?

Undergraduate students in this area have suggested the following resources as being helpful for these topics:

* `DeepLizard Backpropagation and Deep Learning Videos <https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/gZmobeGL0Yg>`__ - provides an in-depth but approachable introduction to deep learning concepts
* The How to Build a Brain Book by Chris Eliasmith

Suggested Background for Georgia Tech Undergrads
------------------------------------------------
* A background in data structures and machine learning concepts (CS 1332 and 4641)
* Special topics courses like `"Computation and the Brain" <https://computationandbrain.wordpress.com/>`__ (CS8803-CAB) when offered
* Courses from the `neuroscience undergraduate track <https://catalog.gatech.edu/courses-undergrad/neur/>`__ like "Principles in Neuroscience" (NEURO 2001) would likely also be helpful but may require more of a biomedical background.

Additional Background and Related Topics
----------------------------------------

Dr. Sam Shapero (GTRI researcher working with LCA and related signal processing topics) suggests understanding the following topics for neuromorphic computing research:

* Porting DNN applications to SNNs 
    * See this paper as an example for Loihi `Massa, et al., An Efficient SNN for Recognizing Gestures...,IJCNN2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09985>`__
* Non-linear dynamics and their attractors 
    * `(YouTube video by Dr. Liz Bradley) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MizhVorgywY>`__
* Basic neuroscience concepts like feed-forward processing, lateral inhibition, etc. 
* Recurrent structures (SNN) to implement systems of non-linear equations
    * LCA is one example of implementing a Hopfield network 
    * See papers like this one: `An Overview of Neuromorphic Computing for AI-Enabled HW-Based Hopfield Neural Network <http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/213034/1/213034.pdf>`__
* Gradient descent applied to spiking circuits 
    * See papers like this one, `Huh, et al.,Gradient Descent for Spiking Neural Networks, NeurIPS18 <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/185e65bc40581880c4f2c82958de8cfe-Paper.pdf>`__
* Basins of attraction; chaotic attractors 
    * `Blackmore, Nonlinear Dynamics, Chaos and Strange Attractors with Applications, 2016 slide overview <https://web.njit.edu/~kondic/791/blackmore/slides.pdf>`__
