===================
Vortex RISC-V GPGPU
===================

The Vortex RISC-V GPGPU is a research project that is focused on developing a RISC-V ISA compatible GPGPU that can execute real code. The `Vortex site <https://vortex.cc.gatech.edu/>`__ has more information on the project including the software stack and recent extensions for executing graphics code. This page focuses on how to get started with using and testing Vortex on the Rogues Gallery.

We suggest that you pair the instructions here with the `Vortex tutorial <https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex_tutorials>`__.

Using Vortex with Rogues Gallery
================================

You can run the Vortex toolchain and simulation on multiple nodes within RG including the `rg-fgpa-dev` VMs, Intel, and Xilinx flubber nodes. Note that the Xilinx port of Vortex is currently in progress, so here we focus on using Vortex with the Intel FPGA nodes (flubber<1-3>).


Vortex Installation Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally we suggest that you use the prebuilt toolchain which includes a RISC-V cross-compiler. 

For Ubuntu:

For RHEL8:


Vortex Software Toolchain
